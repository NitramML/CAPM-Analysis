# Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive financial analysis using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to investigate the relationship between a specific financial asset and the market. The analysis includes detailed exploratory data analysis of financial returns and time-varying beta estimation.

## Key Features
- Descriptive statistics of financial returns
- Autocorrelation analysis using Box-Pierce test
- CAPM regression estimation
- Rolling window beta calculation
- Visualization of time-varying beta
- Market volatility impact analysis

## Methodology
The project implements the following key steps:
1. Compute daily financial returns
2. Analyze return distribution characteristics
3. Perform CAPM regression
4. Estimate time-varying beta using a rolling window approach
5. Visualize and interpret beta changes
